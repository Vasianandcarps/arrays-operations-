###arrays operations 
Create two arbitrary integer arrays. Write a script that:
- removes all duplicate elements from each array;
- outputs the number of duplicate elements of two arrays;
- merges two arrays into one, removing all duplicate values;
- swaps the values ​​of the array (the first element of the array becomes the last, the penultimate element becomes the second, ..., the last element becomes the first). To do this, use the foreach loop (instead of the existing reverse function).
